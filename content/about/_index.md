Hi there! I'm Alexis, _not Alexa._  I'm a Full Stack Developer from Honolulu, Hawaii.  I graduated from the University of Hawaii's Information and Computer Science program and also attended Hawaii's first coding boot camp, Devleague!

Growing up I was always passionate about art and design.  One would figure, "Developer?  Why didn't you become a Graphic Artist or a Web Designer?"  Bada-bing-bada-boom.  Long story short, I couldn't go to art school so I chose to major in what I had thought was the next best thing -- Computer Science.  Before I knew it I was hooked. I had found a new passion that not only allows me to be creative but forces me outside of my comfort zone and challenges me every day.

When I'm not hacking away at my computer I'm jumping on my next flight to see what else this world has to offer!  Check out my travel adventures on my Instagram: [@hikkkkki](https://www.instagram.com/hikkkkki/)
